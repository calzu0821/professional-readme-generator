  ## Description

  The README Generator project was created to simplify and automate the process of generating high-quality README files for software projects. The goal was to develop a tool that streamlines this process and produces consistent and professional README files. Throughout the development process, valuable skills were acquired and reinforced, including working with command-line interfaces, text manipulation, and file I/O operations.
